# Project Name

Iris Dataset Analysis and Classification
This project demonstrates data analysis and a basic classification model using the Iris dataset. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers, classified into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and label columns of the Iris dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize distributions using scatter plots and KDE plots for each feature.
Display correlation matrix and heatmap to show relationships between features.
Label Encoding: Convert species names to numeric labels.
Model Training:
Train a Logistic Regression model to classify iris species based on feature values.
Evaluate model accuracy and make predictions on new inputs.

## Usage

- Load the Data: The script automatically fetches the dataset from the UCI repository.
- Run EDA: Visualize and analyze feature distributions and correlations.
- Train the Model: Fit a Logistic Regression model on the dataset and evaluate its performance.
- Predict on Custom Input: Use the model to predict species from user-defined measurements.


### Results

Accuracy: ~93%
Predicted Class for Custom Input: Returns a class label based on input values.
